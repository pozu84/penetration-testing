Start VM Group 2. Download /exercises/chisel_exercise_client from CONFLUENCE01. There's a server running on port 8008 on PGDATABASE01. Set up a port forward using Chisel that allows you to run chisel_exercise_client against port 8008 on PGDATABASE01.
Note: the source files used to build the chisel_exercise_client binary can be downloaded from /exercises/client_source.zip.
