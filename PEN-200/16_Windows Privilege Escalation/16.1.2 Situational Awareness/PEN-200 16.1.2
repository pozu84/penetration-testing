Question 1
Check the users of the local group Remote Management Users on CLIENTWK220 (VM #1). Enter a user which is in this group apart from steve.

Connect to your assigned VM #1 using the netcat bind shell on port 4444, as demonstrated in Listing 6.
To view the list of users in the Remote Management Users group, refer to the command in Listing 10 (16.1.2).

nc 192.168.182.220 4444
C:\Users\dave> powershell

PS C:\Users\dave> Get-LocalGroup
PS C:\Users\dave> Get-LocalGroupMember 'Remote Management Users'
User        CLIENTWK220\daveadmin Local          
User        CLIENTWK220\steve     Local

Question 2 
Enumerate the installed applications on CLIENTWK220 (VM #1) and find the flag.
HINT
Connect to your assigned VM #1 using the netcat bind shell on port 4444.
Refer to the Listing 15 to find out the installed applications.
To display all properties, remove 'select displayname' from the command.

Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*"
# No flag was found

Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*" 
PSProvider      : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\Registry
(default)    : OS{a2a7fdea0653aa45483e0ac1e8cc4706}

Questions 3
We'll now use an additional machine, CLIENTWK221 (VM #2), to practice what we learned in this section. Access the machine via RDP as user mac with the password IAmTheGOATSysAdmin!. Identify another member of the local Administrators group apart from offsec and Administrator.
HINT
Refer to Listing 10 for local Administrators group users.

xfreerdp /u:mac /p:IAmTheGOATSysAdmin! /v:192.168.192.221:3389 

# Open Powershell
PS C:\Users\mac> Get-LocalGroupMember 'Administrators'
User        CLIENTWK221\Administrator Local
User        CLIENTWK221\offsec        Local
User        CLIENTWK221\roy           Local

Questions 4
Enumerate the currently running processes on CLIENTWK221 (VM #2). Find a non-standard process and locate the flag in the directory of the corresponding binary file.
HINT
Refer to the Listing 16 to retrieve a list of all running processes.
Look for non-standard processes by checking unusual names or locations in the output.
Identify the process binary file path, then check the binary file path to obtain the flag.

PS C:\Users\mac> Get-Process
