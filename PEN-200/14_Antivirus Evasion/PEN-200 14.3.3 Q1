Questions 1
Use Shellter to inject a Meterpreter reverse shell payload in the Spotify executable, then transfer the binary to your Window 11 client VM #1 and ensure that it is not being detected by the antivirus. After, set up a Meterpreter listener, run the backdoored Spotify installer, and verify that you have obtained an interactive shell. As an additional exercise, attempt to find different executables and inject malicious code into them using Shellter.

Which Shellter option is responsible for restoring the execution flow of the backdoored binary and therefore avoids any unwanted suspicion?
Stealth Mode

sudo apt install shellter
sudo apt install wine
dpkg --add-architecture i386 && apt-get update &&
apt-get install wine32

# Before We start the Shellter tools, prepare a legit software installer, we will use notepad++ v8.6.5 latest installer
Get the Notepad++ windows installer and place it to /home/kali/Desktop
https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v8.6.5/
