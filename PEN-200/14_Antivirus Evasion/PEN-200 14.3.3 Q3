Capstone Exercise: Similar to the previous exercise, you'll be facing off against COMODO antivirus engine v12.2.2.8012 on Module Exercise VM #2. Although the PowerShell AV bypass we covered in this Module is substantial, it has an inherent limitation. The malicious script cannot be double-clicked by the user for an immediate execution. Instead, it would open in notepad.exe or another default text editor. The tradecraft of manually weaponizing PowerShell scripts is beyond the scope of this module, but we can rely on another open-source framework to help us automate this process.
