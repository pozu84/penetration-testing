Capstone Exercise: In this exercise, you'll be facing off against COMODO antivirus engine running on Module Exercise VM #1. Use another popular 32-bit application, like PuTTY, to replicate the steps learned so far in order to inject malicious code in the binary with Shellter. The victim machine runs an anonymous FTP server with open read/write permissions. Every few seconds, the victim user will double-click on any existing .exe file(s) in the FTP root directory. If the antivirus flags the script as malicious, the script will be quarantined and then deleted. Otherwise, the script will execute and hopefully, grant you a reverse shell. NOTE: set the FTP session as active and enable binary encoding while transferring the file.
