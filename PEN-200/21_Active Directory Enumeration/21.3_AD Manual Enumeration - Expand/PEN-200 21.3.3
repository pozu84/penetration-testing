#  To wrap up our discussion of user enumeration, we'll shift our focus to Service Accounts,1 which may also be members of high-privileged groups. Services launched by the system itself run in the context of a Service Account such as LocalSystem, LocalService, and NetworkService. When applications like Exchange, MS SQL, or Internet Information Services (IIS) are integrated into AD, a unique service instance identifier known as Service Principal Name (SPN) associates a service to a specific service account in Active Directory.

# We can obtain the IP address and port number of applications running on servers integrated with AD by simply enumerating all SPNs in the domain, meaning we don't need to run a broad port scan. To obtain the data, we will again query the DC, this time searching for specific SPNs.

# To enumerate SPNs in the domain, we have multiple options. In this case, we'll use setspn.exe, which is installed on Windows by default. We'll use -L to run against both servers and clients in the domain.

# Another way of enumerating SPNs is to let PowerView enumerate all the accounts in the domain. To obtain a clear list of SPNs, we can pipe the output into select and choose the samaccountname and serviceprincipalname attributes:
PS C:\Tools> Get-NetUser -SPN | select samaccountname,serviceprincipalname
