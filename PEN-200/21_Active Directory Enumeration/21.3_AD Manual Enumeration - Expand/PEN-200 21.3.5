# In this instance, we'll first focus on SYSVOL,1 as it may include files and folders that reside on the domain controller itself. This particular share is typically used for various domain policies and scripts. By default, the SYSVOL folder is mapped to %SystemRoot%\SYSVOL\Sysvol\domain-name on the domain controller and every domain user has access to it.

# Due to the naming of the folder and the name of the file itself, it appears that this is an older domain policy file. This is a common artifact on domain shares as system administrators often forget them when implementing new policies. In this particular case, the XML file describes an old policy  and an encrypted password for the local built-in Administrator account. The encrypted password could be extremely valuable for us.

# Historically, system administrators often changed local workstation passwords through Group Policy Preferences (GPP). However, even though GPP-stored passwords are encrypted with AES-256, the private key for the encryption has been posted on MSDN.3 We can use this key to decrypt these encrypted passwords. In this case, we'll use the gpp-decrypt4 ruby script in Kali Linux that decrypts a given GPP encrypted string:
kali@kali:~$ gpp-decrypt "+bsY0V3d4/KgX3VJdO/vyepPfAN1zMFTiQDApgR92JE"

# Besides from this password, we had discovered another interesting domainshare "docshare" on FILES04.corp.com

The username I'm sure you already know, but here you have the brand new auto generated password as well: HenchmanPutridBonbon11
...

# According to the text in this file, jeff stored an email with a possible cleartext password: HenchmanPutridBonbon11! Although the password may have been changed, we will make a note of it in our documentation. Between this password and the password we discovered earlier, we're building a rough profile of the password policy used for both users and computers in the organization. We could use this to create specific wordlists that we can use for password guessing and brute force, if needed.
