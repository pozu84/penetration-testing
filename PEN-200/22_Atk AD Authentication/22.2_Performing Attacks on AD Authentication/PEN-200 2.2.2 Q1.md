Follow the steps outlined in this section to obtain the plaintext password of dave on Windows and Kali by performing AS-REP Roasting. What is the correct Hashcat mode to crack AS-REP hashes?
# Answer
18200

# The first step of the authentication process via Kerberos is to send an AS-REQ. Based on this request, the domain controller can validate if the authentication is successful. If it is, the domain controller replies with an AS-REP containing the session key and TGT. This step is also commonly referred to as Kerberos preauthentication1 and prevents offline password guessing.

# Without Kerberos preauthentication in place, an attacker could send an AS-REQ to the domain controller on behalf of any AD user. After obtaining the AS-REP from the domain controller, the attacker could perform an offline password attack against the encrypted part of the response. This attack is known as AS-REP Roasting. AD user account option Do not require Kerberos preauthentication is disabled, meaning that Kerberos preauthentication is performed for all users. However, it is possible to enable this account option manually. In assessments, we may find accounts with this option enabled as some applications and technologies require it to function properly. 

# On Kali, we can use impacket-GetNPUsers3 to perform AS-REP roasting. We'll need to enter the IP address of the domain controller as an argument for -dc-ip, the name of the output file in which the AS-REP hash will be stored in Hashcat format for -outputfile, and -request to request the TGT.

# Hashcat successfully cracked the AS-REP hash. Above shows that the user dave has the password Flowers1.

# ! Methods 2 !
# We can also perform AS-REP Roasting on Windows. We'll use Rubeus,4 which is a toolset for raw Kerberos interactions and abuses. To perform this attack, we'll connect to CLIENT75 via RDP as domain user jeff with the password HenchmanPutridBonbon11. Next, we can start a PowerShell window and navigate to C:\Tools, where Rubeus.exe can be found.
xfreerdp /cert-ignore /u:jeff /d:corp.com /p:HenchmanPutridBonbon11 /v:192.168.163.75

# To identify users with the enabled AD user account option Do not require Kerberos preauthentication, we can use PowerView's Get-DomainUser function with the option -PreauthNotRequired on Windows. On Kali, we can use impacket-GetNPUsers as shown in listing 14 without the -request and -outputfile options.

# Let's assume that we are conducting an assessment in which we cannot identify any AD users with the account option Do not require Kerberos preauthentication enabled. While enumerating, we notice that we have GenericWrite or GenericAll permissions5 on another AD user account. Using these permissions, we could reset their passwords, but this would lock out the user from accessing the account. We could also leverage these permissions to modify the User Account Control value of the user to not require Kerberos preauthentication.6 This attack is known as Targeted AS-REP Roasting. Notably, we should reset the User Account Control value of the user once we've obtained the hash.
