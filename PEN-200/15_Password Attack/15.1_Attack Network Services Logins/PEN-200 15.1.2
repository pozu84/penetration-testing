Question 2
The web page on VM #2 is password protected. Use Hydra to perform a password attack and get access as user admin. Once you have identified the correct password, enter it as answer to this exercise. The authentication mechanism here is HTTP basic authentication.
Hydra support various protocols such as http-get and http-post which can be used depending on the application to perform a dictionary attack to obtain the password.
