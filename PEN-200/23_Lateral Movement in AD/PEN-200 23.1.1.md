Topics: WMI and WinRM Lateral Movement
Questions 1
Launch VM Group 1 and repeat the steps discussed in this section. Which PowerShell cmdlet has been used to create a WMI session?
# Answer

# The first lateral movement technique we are going to cover is based on Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), which is an object-oriented feature that facilitates task automation.

# WMI is capable of creating processes via the Create method from the Win32_Process class. It communicates through Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) over port 135 for remote access and uses a higher-range port (19152-65535) for session data.

# To create a process on the remote target via WMI, we need the credentials of a member of the Administrators local group, which can also be a domain user. In the following examples, we are going to perform the attacks as the user jen, which is both a domain user and a member of the Local Administrator group for the target machines.

# Historically, wmic has been abused for lateral movement via the command line by specifying the target IP after the /node: argument then the user after the /user: argument, and then the password after the /password: argument.
