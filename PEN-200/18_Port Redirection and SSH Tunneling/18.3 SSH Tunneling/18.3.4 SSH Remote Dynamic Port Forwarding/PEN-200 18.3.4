Questions 1 
Follow the steps in this section to set up a remote dynamic port forward from CONFLUENCE01. Scan ports 9000-9100 on MULTISERVER03 through it. Which port is open? (Note: Make sure to scan MULTISERVER03 on its internal interface at 10.4.X.64).

HINT
Repeat the steps in this learning unit. In the last step, you can conduct a port scan on host 10.4.X.64 (make sure to adjust the third subnet accordingly) on ports 9000-9100 using either netcat or Nmap.

# Lets try to get the CONFLUENCE01 shell
#Setup MSFConsole to listen port 4444

Capstone Exercise: Download the ssh_remote_dynamic_client binary from the CONFLUENCE01 web server at http://CONFLUENCE01:8090/exercises/ssh_remote_dynamic_client. Run it against the port you just found on MULTISERVER03 through the remote dynamic port forward.
Note: the source files used to build the ssh_remote_dynamic_client binary can be downloaded from /exercises/client_source.zip.

# Obtain payload
wget http://192.168.180.63:8090/exercises/ssh_remote_dynamic_client
