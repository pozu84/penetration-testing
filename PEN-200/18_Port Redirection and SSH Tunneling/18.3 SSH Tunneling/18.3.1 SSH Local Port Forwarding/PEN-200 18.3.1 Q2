Questions 2
Start VM Group 2. A server is running on HRSHARES port 4242. Download the ssh_local_client binary from http://CONFLUENCE01:8090/exercises/ssh_local_client. Create an SSH local port forward on CONFLUENCE01, which will let you run the ssh_local_client from your Kali machine against the server on HRSHARES and retrieve the flag.

Note: the source files used to build the ssh_local_client binary can be downloaded from /exercises/client_source.zip.

HINT
Enable Python's pty module after getting a shell on Confluence.
Set up port forwarding as in Listing 20, changing the port to 4242 and IP.
Download ssh_local_client via browser.
Use the -h argument for help if issues arise with the binary.
